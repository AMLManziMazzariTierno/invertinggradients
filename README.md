# Inverting Gradients - How easy is it to break Privacy in Federated Learning?

---------------------

**Update Feb 2022: A modernized implementation of this attack (and many other attacks) is included in our newest framework for privacy attacks in FL:**

### Quick Start
"ResNet20 - trained.ipynb" for the attack that reconstruct a single image from trained ResNet20.

Use models/instaHideResNet20_k=1.pt file in previous notebook for the attack on instaHide trained net.

"ResNet20 - Recovering multiple CIFAR-100 images.ipynb" for the attack that reconstruct multiple images from trained ResNet20.
